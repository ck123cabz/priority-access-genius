## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.6 successfully implemented activation link generation and display. The dashboard components and client service layer are established and working well. The dashboard already has a client list that refreshes after manual actions (client creation). This story will enhance the existing dashboard to receive automatic updates via Supabase Realtime when clients are created or their status changes, eliminating the need for manual page refreshes.

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
**Client Model Real-time Events:**
The `clients` table will emit real-time events for:
- INSERT events when new clients are created
- UPDATE events when client status changes from 'pending' to 'activated'
- Fields to monitor for changes: `status`, `updated_at`

**Key Event Structure:**
```typescript
interface RealtimeClientEvent {
  eventType: 'INSERT' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
  new: Client | null;     // New row data
  old: Client | null;     // Old row data (UPDATE/DELETE only)
  table: 'clients';
}
```

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
**Supabase Realtime Integration:**
- Supabase Realtime provides live database updates via WebSocket connection
- Client SDK connects directly to Realtime service
- RLS policies apply to Realtime subscriptions (operators only see their clients)

[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md - Workflow 2]
**Real-time Update Flow:**
- Database changes trigger Realtime events
- Realtime pushes updates to subscribed clients
- Dashboard receives events within 2 seconds and updates UI

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture-selected-highlights.md]
- State management via React hooks
- Component organization follows established patterns in `app/**/components`
- Use existing dashboard component structure

[Source: architecture/6-components.md]
**Dashboard UI Enhancement:**
- Operator Dashboard UI already exists with Supabase SDK integration
- Need to add Realtime subscription capability
- Maintain existing UI patterns and component structure

### File Locations

[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
Based on the unified project structure, modifications needed:
```
apps/web/src/
  app/
    (dashboard)/
      dashboard/
        page.tsx                          # Existing - may need updates for Realtime
        components/
          client-list.tsx                 # Existing - needs Realtime subscription

    client-service.ts                     # Existing - no changes needed
  hooks/
    use-realtime-clients.ts               # New hook for Realtime subscription
```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7 + React Testing Library
- **Test File Location:** `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` or co-located with components
- **Mock Strategy:** 
  - Mock Supabase Realtime client for predictable event simulation
  - Mock WebSocket connections for connection state testing
  - Simulate INSERT/UPDATE events with test client data
- **Test Coverage Required:**
  - Realtime subscription setup and cleanup
  - Client list updates from simulated events
  - Connection status handling and error scenarios
  - RLS compliance with real-time subscriptions

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with App Router
- **UI Components:** ShadCN/UI for consistent component styling
- **State Management:** React Context/Hooks for local state management
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15.1 via Supabase with RLS policies
- **Real-time:** Supabase Realtime via WebSocket connections

**Supabase Realtime Constraints:**
- WebSocket connection limits per client
- RLS policies must be properly configured for Realtime
- Subscription cleanup required to prevent memory leaks

### Security Requirements

[Source: architecture/15-security-performance.md]
- RLS policies must enforce that operators only receive real-time updates for their own clients
- Realtime subscriptions must respect the same security boundaries as regular queries
- No sensitive data should be logged in Realtime error handling
- Connection tokens and credentials must be handled securely

### Performance Considerations

**Real-time Update Performance:**
- Updates must occur within 2 seconds as per AC
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders during real-time updates
- Efficient client list state management to handle frequent updates
- Connection pooling and proper WebSocket management

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
- Service layer pattern: Create reusable hooks for Realtime functionality
- Hooks prefix `use*` for custom React hooks
- ESLint + Prettier enforced for code consistency
- Component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns

### Error Handling

[Source: architecture/18-error-handling-strategy.md]
- Standard error shape `{ code, message, details? }` for Realtime errors
- Graceful degradation if Realtime connection fails
- User notification for connection status (connected/disconnected/reconnecting)
- Fallback to manual refresh if Realtime is unavailable
- Proper error logging without exposing sensitive client data

### Project Structure Notes

The existing dashboard architecture from previous stories provides a solid foundation. The client list component and data hooks are already established. This story enhances the existing dashboard with real-time capabilities without requiring new routes or major structural changes. All file locations align with the unified project structure established in previous stories.
