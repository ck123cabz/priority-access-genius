# Story 1.6: Generate & Display Activation Link

## Status

Done 

## Story

**As an** Operator,
**I want** to receive a unique, tokenized activation link after creating a client,
**so that** I can share it with the client.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. After successful client creation, a unique token is generated
2. The full activation URL is displayed to the operator with a "copy-to-clipboard" button
3. The activation token is generated using `crypto.randomUUID()`, stored in the `clients` table, and includes a 24-hour expiry mechanism

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.5 successfully implemented client creation with form validation, logo upload, and service layer integration. The modal-based workflow and client creation flow are established. The client service layer (`createClient()` function) is working well and should be extended to include activation token generation. The dashboard already refreshes the client list after creation, which will now include the activation links.

### Data Models

[Source: packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma - lines 26-27]
**Client Model Activation Fields:**
```typescript
interface Client {
  // ... existing fields ...
  activation_token: string | null;  // Unique token for activation URL
  token_expires_at: Date | null;    // Token expiration timestamp (24 hours)
  // ... other fields ...
}
```

**Key Validation Rules:**
- Activation token must be unique (enforced by database index)
- Token expiration must be set when token is generated
- Both fields should be null after successful activation

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
**Supabase Client SDK:**
- Token generation happens server-side using crypto.randomUUID()
- RLS policies ensure operators can only view tokens for their own clients
- Activation URL format: `{BASE_URL}/activate/{token}`

[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md - Workflow 1]
**Updated Operator Creates Client Workflow:**
- After client record creation, system generates unique activation token
- Token and expiry stored in database
- Activation link returned to operator for sharing

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/6-components.md]
- Component organization follows established pattern in `app/**/components`
- Must use ShadCN/UI components for consistent styling
- Toast notifications for user feedback on copy actions

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture-selected-highlights.md]
- Component organization: `components/ui`, `components/composed`, `app/**/components`
- State management via React hooks
- App Router with `(dashboard)` route group

```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7 + React Testing Library
- **Test File Location:** `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` or co-located with components
- **Mock Strategy:** Mock crypto.randomUUID() and Date for predictable tests
- **Test Coverage Required:**
  - Token generation logic in service layer
  - Activation link display component functionality
  - Copy-to-clipboard functionality
  - Expiration time calculation and formatting
  - Integration with existing client creation flow

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with App Router
- **UI Components:** ShadCN/UI for accessible, unstyled components
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ~3.4 for utility-first CSS framework
- **State Management:** React Context/Hooks for local state
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15.1 via Supabase with RLS policies
- **ORM:** Prisma ~5.15 for type-safe database access

### Security Requirements

[Source: architecture/15-security-performance.md]
- Activation tokens must be cryptographically secure (crypto.randomUUID())
- Tokens must have expiration mechanism (24 hours as per AC)
- RLS policies must prevent unauthorized access to activation tokens
- BASE_URL must be configured securely via environment variables
- Never log or expose full activation tokens in error messages

### Environment Configuration

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` - Base URL for generating activation links
- Must be configured in `.env.local` for development
- Must be configured in Vercel environment settings for production

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
- Service layer for Supabase calls; no direct calls in components
- Hooks prefix `use*`, server components in `app/**/page.tsx`
- ESLint + Prettier enforced
- Utility functions should be pure and testable

### Error Handling

[Source: architecture/18-error-handling-strategy.md]
- Standard error shape `{ code, message, details? }`
- UI toasts for user feedback on copy success/failure
- Graceful handling of expired tokens
- Clear error messages if token generation fails

### Project Structure Notes

The dashboard components and client service layer are already established from previous stories. This story extends the existing client creation flow by adding token generation at creation time and displaying the activation link in multiple places (creation modal and client list). The component locations align with the unified project structure. No new routes are needed; this story only enhances existing dashboard functionality.
