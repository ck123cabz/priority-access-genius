# Story 1.3: Operator Authentication

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** Operator,
**I want** to log in to the application using my Google account,
**so that** I can securely access the operator dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `/login` page initiates the Supabase Auth OAuth flow with Google
2. Upon success, the user is redirected to `/dashboard`
3. Dashboard routes are protected

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2b successfully completed the database migration setup with comprehensive testing. The Supabase database is fully configured with RLS policies, and the development environment is ready for authentication integration.

### Authentication Architecture
[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md]
The operator authentication follows this workflow:
1. Operator accesses Dashboard
2. App verifies user session with Supabase Auth  
3. If session valid, user proceeds to dashboard
4. Auth integrates with RLS policies for data access control

[Source: architecture/15-security-performance.md]
- RLS everywhere; JWT claims checked in policies
- Authentication must integrate with existing RLS policies

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth for user authentication and Google OAuth integration
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with App Router
- **UI Components:** ShadCN/UI for accessible, unstyled components
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ~3.4 for utility-first CSS framework
- **State Management:** React Context/Hooks for session management

### Project Structure & File Locations
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
Based on the unified project structure:
```
apps/web/src/
  app/
    (auth)/              # Auth route group 
      login/
        page.tsx         # Login page
    (dashboard)/         # Protected dashboard group
      dashboard/
        page.tsx         # Dashboard page
  middleware.ts          # Route protection middleware
  components/ui/         # ShadCN/UI components
  lib/
    supabase.ts          # Supabase client (already exists)
```

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture-selected-highlights.md]
- App Router with `(auth)`, `(dashboard)` route groups
- Protected routes via `middleware.ts`
- Component organization: `components/ui`, `components/composed`, `app/**/components`

### Authentication Integration Details
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md & architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
- RLS Policies: "Operators can select/insert/update clients where created_by = auth.uid()"
- JWT integration with existing database policies
- User session must be available for subsequent client operations

### Development Environment Configuration
[Source: architecture/13-development-workflow.md]
- **Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, pnpm 9+, Docker Desktop, Supabase CLI
- **Local Supabase:** Use `supabase start` for local development
- Environment variables needed for Google OAuth configuration

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/6-components.md]
- Authentication UI component needs to integrate with Core Services (DB/Auth/Storage)
- Must follow shared component patterns with SharedTypes integration

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/15-security-performance.md]
- JWT claims validation in RLS policies
- Secure session management
- Protected route middleware implementation

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit/Component Tests:** Jest + React Testing Library
- **Test file location:** `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` or `tests/` directory
- **Mock Strategy:** Authentication mocks for test users with different permission levels
- **Test Coverage:** Auth component rendering, middleware protection, session management

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing Supabase local development setup
- Authentication must integrate seamlessly with RLS policies
- OAuth redirect URLs must support both local and production environments
- Session state must persist across page refreshes

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
- Hooks prefix `use*`, server components in `app/**/page.tsx`
- Service layer for Supabase calls; no direct calls in components
- ESLint + Prettier enforced

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts identified. The route structure with `(auth)` and `(dashboard)` groups aligns perfectly with the unified project structure. The middleware.ts location is standard for Next.js App Router protection.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7 + React Testing Library
- **Test File Location:** `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` or co-located with components
- **Setup:** Jest config already exists at `apps/web/jest.config.ts`
- **Mock Strategy:** Mock Supabase Auth for predictable test responses
- **Test Types Required:**
  - Component rendering tests for login page
  - Middleware route protection logic tests  
  - Authentication hook/context behavior tests
  - OAuth flow integration tests (mocked)
- **CI Integration:** Tests run in GitHub Actions workflow
- **Coverage Requirements:** All authentication components and middleware must have unit tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation demonstrates excellent authentication architecture with comprehensive Google OAuth integration. The solution properly implements Next.js App Router patterns with protected routes, clean component separation, and robust error handling. All acceptance criteria are fully met with proper testing coverage.

### Refactoring Performed

Identified and fixed coding standards violation for service layer architecture:

- **File**: `apps/web/src/lib/auth-service.ts`
  - **Change**: Created auth service abstraction layer
  - **Why**: Coding standards require "Service layer for Supabase calls; no direct calls in components"
  - **How**: Encapsulated all Supabase auth operations behind clean interface

- **File**: `apps/web/src/components/auth-provider.tsx`
  - **Change**: Refactored to use auth service instead of direct Supabase calls
  - **Why**: Maintains clean architecture and testability
  - **How**: Replaced direct `supabaseClient.auth` calls with `authService` methods

- **File**: `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
  - **Change**: Updated to use auth service for OAuth flow
  - **Why**: Consistent service layer usage across application
  - **How**: Replaced `signInWithOAuth` call with `authService.signInWithGoogle`

- **File**: `apps/web/src/__mocks__/auth-service.ts`
  - **Change**: Created mock for auth service
  - **Why**: Enables clean testing of service layer abstraction
  - **How**: Implemented Jest-compatible mock with proper TypeScript types

- **Files**: All test files updated to use auth service mocks
  - **Change**: Updated test mocks to use new service layer
  - **Why**: Maintains test coverage with improved architecture
  - **How**: Replaced Supabase client mocks with auth service mocks

### Compliance Check
