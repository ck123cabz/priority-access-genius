# Story 1.4: Client Dashboard UI & Data Connection

## Status
Done
## Story
**As an** Operator,
**I want** to see a dashboard that displays a list of clients I have created,
**so that** I can track their status.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The dashboard fetches and displays a list of clients created by the logged-in operator
2. An "empty state" is shown if there are no clients

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create client service layer for data operations (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `apps/web/src/lib/client-service.ts` following established service layer pattern
  - [x] Implement `getClientsByOperator()` function with RLS-aware queries
  - [x] Add TypeScript interfaces for client data based on Prisma models
  - [x] Include proper error handling and loading states
- [x] Design and implement client list UI components (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `ClientList` component in `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/components/`
  - [x] Create `ClientCard` component for individual client display
  - [x] Implement empty state component with appropriate messaging
  - [x] Use ShadCN/UI components for consistent styling
- [x] Integrate client list into existing dashboard page (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` to fetch and display clients
  - [x] Add React hooks for client data state management
  - [x] Handle loading and error states appropriately
  - [x] Test with authenticated operator context from previous story
- [x] Write unit tests for client dashboard components (Testing Requirements)
  - [x] Test ClientList component rendering with mock data
  - [x] Test empty state display when no clients exist
  - [x] Test client service layer functions with mocked Supabase responses
  - [x] Test dashboard page integration with client fetching

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 successfully established the authentication foundation with Google OAuth, protected routing middleware, and a service layer pattern. The authentication context provides session management and the auth service abstraction is working well. RLS policies are active and JWT claims are properly validated. The established service layer pattern should be followed for client operations.

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
**Client Model:**
```typescript
interface Client {
  id: string;
  company_name: string;
  contact_name: string;
  email: string;
  role_title: string;
  notes: string | null;
  logo_url: string | null;
  status: 'pending' | 'activated';
  created_by: string;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}
```

**Key Relationships:**
- One-to-Many: A Client can have many Agreements
- RLS Policy: "Operators can select/insert/update clients where created_by = auth.uid()"

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
**RLS Policies:**
- Operators can `select/insert/update` clients where `created_by = auth.uid()`
- Database operations must work through service layer, no direct Supabase calls in components

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/6-components.md]
- **Operator Dashboard UI** integrates with Supabase SDK
- Must use SharedTypes Package (Prisma-generated types)
- Component organization: `components/ui`, `components/composed`, `app/**/components`

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture-selected-highlights.md]
- Component organization: `components/ui`, `components/composed`, `app/**/components`
- State management via React hooks
- App Router with `(dashboard)` route group

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
Based on the unified project structure:
```
apps/web/src/
  app/
    (dashboard)/
      dashboard/
        page.tsx                    # Main dashboard page (update existing)
        components/
          client-list.tsx           # Client list component
          client-card.tsx           # Individual client card
          empty-state.tsx           # Empty state component
  lib/
    client-service.ts               # Client data service layer
  components/ui/                    # ShadCN/UI components (reuse existing)
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7 + React Testing Library
- **Test File Location:** `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` or co-located with components
- **Mock Strategy:** Mock client service for predictable test responses
- **Test Coverage Required:**
  - Component rendering tests for ClientList and ClientCard
  - Empty state display testing
  - Client service layer function testing
  - Dashboard page integration with client fetching

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with App Router
- **UI Components:** ShadCN/UI for accessible, unstyled components
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ~3.4 for utility-first CSS framework
- **State Management:** React Context/Hooks for local state
- **ORM:** Prisma ~5.15 for type-safe database access
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15.1 via Supabase

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
- Must respect RLS policies: operators can only see clients where `created_by = auth.uid()`
- All database queries must be performed through authenticated context
- JWT claims validation handled automatically by RLS

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
- Service layer for Supabase calls; no direct calls in components
- Hooks prefix `use*`, server components in `app/**/page.tsx`
- ESLint + Prettier enforced

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts identified. The dashboard page already exists from Story 1.3 and needs enhancement to display client data. Component locations align with the unified project structure. Service layer pattern is established and should be followed.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

### Review Date: 2025-08-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation follows established patterns and maintains high quality standards. Service layer abstraction is properly implemented, components are well-structured with clear separation of concerns, and TypeScript interfaces provide good type safety. Error handling is comprehensive throughout the stack.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required during this review. The code already follows best practices and established patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows hook naming (`use*`), service layer pattern, ESLint passes
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized in `app/**/components`, service in `lib/`
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Jest + RTL tests cover components and service layer appropriately
