## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.4 successfully established the client dashboard display with service layer pattern, loading/error states, and comprehensive testing. The client service layer is working well with RLS-aware queries and proper TypeScript interfaces. The established patterns should be extended for client creation operations. Component organization in `app/**/components` is working effectively.

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
**Client Model for Creation:**
```typescript
interface Client {
  id: string; // Auto-generated UUID
  company_name: string; // Required
  contact_name: string; // Required
  email: string; // Required
  role_title: string; // Required
  notes: string | null; // Optional
  logo_url: string | null; // Optional, from Supabase Storage
  status: 'pending' | 'activated'; // Default to 'pending'
  created_by: string; // Auto-populated from auth.uid()
  created_at: Date; // Auto-generated
  updated_at: Date; // Auto-generated
}
```

**Key Validation Rules:**
- All string fields except notes are required
- Email field should have proper email validation
- File uploads restricted to image types only

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
**Supabase Client SDK:**
- CRUD operations via Supabase JavaScript Client with RLS enforcement
- Prisma-generated types ensure end-to-end type safety
- Storage operations for logo upload to `logos` bucket

[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
**Storage Buckets:**
- `logos` bucket: public-read, write via RLS
- File uploads must respect RLS policies for operator access

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/6-components.md]
- **Operator Dashboard UI** integrates with Supabase SDK for data operations
- Must use SharedTypes Package (Prisma-generated types) for type safety
- Component organization: `components/ui`, `components/composed`, `app/**/components`

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture-selected-highlights.md]
- Component organization: `components/ui`, `components/composed`, `app/**/components`
- State management via React hooks
- App Router with `(dashboard)` route group

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
Based on the unified project structure:
```
apps/web/src/
  app/
    (dashboard)/
      dashboard/
        page.tsx                    # Main dashboard page (add create button)
        components/
          client-create-form.tsx    # Client creation form component
          logo-upload.tsx           # Logo upload component
  lib/
    client-service.ts               # Extend with createClient function
  components/ui/                    # ShadCN/UI components (reuse existing)
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7 + React Testing Library
- **Test File Location:** `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` or co-located with components
- **Mock Strategy:** Mock Supabase client and storage operations for predictable tests
- **Test Coverage Required:**
  - Form component rendering and validation tests
  - File upload component testing with mock file operations
  - Client service layer function testing with mocked responses
  - Integration testing for form submission flow
  - Error handling tests for failed uploads and network issues

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with App Router
- **UI Components:** ShadCN/UI for accessible, unstyled components
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ~3.4 for utility-first CSS framework
- **State Management:** React Context/Hooks for local state
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage for logo uploads
- **ORM:** Prisma ~5.15 for type-safe database access
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15.1 via Supabase

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
- RLS policies enforce operators can only `insert` clients where `created_by = auth.uid()`
- Logo uploads to `logos` bucket must respect RLS write permissions
- All database operations must be performed through authenticated context
- File upload validation must prevent malicious file types

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
- Service layer for Supabase calls; no direct calls in components
- Hooks prefix `use*`, server components in `app/**/page.tsx`
- ESLint + Prettier enforced

### Error Handling
[Source: architecture/18-error-handling-strategy.md]
- Standard error shape `{ code, message, details? }`
- UI toasts for user feedback on form submission success/failure
- Proper error boundaries around form components

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts identified. The dashboard page already exists from previous stories and needs enhancement to include client creation functionality. Component locations align with the unified project structure. Service layer pattern is established and should be extended for creation operations. File upload functionality needs to be integrated with existing Supabase Storage setup.

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid architecture patterns and comprehensive testing coverage. All acceptance criteria have been met with proper form validation, secure file upload functionality, and service layer integration. The code follows established patterns from previous stories and maintains consistency with the project's architecture.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx
  - **Change**: Extracted duplicate fetchClients logic into a shared useCallback hook
  - **Why**: Eliminated code duplication and improved React hooks dependency management
  - **How**: Used useCallback to memoize the function and properly manage dependencies

- **File**: apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/components/logo-upload.tsx
  - **Change**: Improved memory management in file upload handler
  - **Why**: Prevents potential memory leaks from unreleased object URLs
  - **How**: Added try/finally block to ensure URL.revokeObjectURL is always called

- **File**: apps/web/src/lib/client-service.ts
  - **Change**: Updated CreateClientData interface for better TypeScript consistency
  - **Why**: Ensures null handling consistency between interface and implementation
  - **How**: Changed optional string properties to string | null to match database schema

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Service layer pattern followed, no direct Supabase calls in components
- Project Structure: ✓ Files organized according to unified structure in app/**/components
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests for all components and service functions
- All ACs Met: ✓ Form creation, logo upload, and client creation fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored dashboard page for better React hooks management (page.tsx)

### Security Review

✓ **File Upload Security**: Proper file type validation (PNG, JPG, JPEG only), size limits (5MB), and server-side validation through Supabase Storage policies.

✓ **RLS Compliance**: All database operations properly use RLS policies with `created_by = auth.uid()` enforcement.

✓ **Input Validation**: Client-side form validation with proper email regex and required field checks.

✓ **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without exposing internal implementation details.

### Performance Considerations

✓ **File Upload**: Efficient streaming upload to Supabase Storage with progress tracking.
