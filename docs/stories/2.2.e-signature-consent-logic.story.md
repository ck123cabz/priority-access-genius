# Story 2.2: E-Signature & Consent Logic

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Client,
**I want** the activation button to be enabled only after I provide my name and consent,
**so that** I cannot submit the agreement accidentally.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.1 successfully implemented the client activation page UI with comprehensive token validation, professional design using ShadCN/UI components, and proper error handling. The existing ActivationForm component provides the foundation for adding e-signature consent logic. The infrastructure for client data fetching, token validation, and responsive design is already established and can be extended.

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
**Agreement Model:** This story prepares for signature collection that will be stored in the Agreement model:
- `signer_name`: string - The full name the client types as their e-signature
- `signed_at`: Date - The exact timestamp when the client confirms their agreement
- `signer_ip`: string - The IP address of the client at the time of signing

**Client Model:** Continues using existing client data:
- `company_name`: string - Display for context in the consent form
- `status`: 'pending' | 'activated' - Still pending until signature is persisted
- `activation_token`: string | null - Token validation continues from Story 2.1

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
**Database Access Pattern:** Continue using service layer pattern established in Story 2.1. No new API calls needed for this story - this focuses on client-side form validation before signature submission in subsequent stories.

**Form Submission Preparation:** The form state and validation will prepare data for the signature persistence that will be implemented in Story 2.3.

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture-selected-highlights.md]
**Component Organization:**
- Enhance existing `ActivationForm` component in `app/activate/[token]/components/`
- Use ShadCN/UI `Input` and `Checkbox` components from `components/ui/`
- Maintain existing `PageHeader` with `cn()` utility for consistent styling
- Continue React hooks pattern for state management

[Source: architecture/6-components.md]
**Client Activation UI Component:** This story enhances the existing Frontend Component that invokes core BaaS services by adding form validation and consent collection functionality.

### File Locations

[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
Based on the unified project structure and Story 2.1 implementation:
```
apps/web/
  app/activate/[token]/
    components/
      activation-form.tsx              # Enhance existing component
      activation-form-fields.tsx       # New: form fields component
  src/hooks/
    use-activation-form.ts             # New: custom form validation hook
  src/components/ui/                   # Use existing ShadCN/UI components
    input.tsx                          # Existing component
    checkbox.tsx                       # Existing component
    button.tsx                         # Existing component
```

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with App Router
- **UI Component Library:** ShadCN/UI Latest for accessible, unstyled components
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ~3.4 for utility-first CSS framework
- **State Management:** React Context/Hooks sufficient for form state management
- **TypeScript:** ~5.4 for type safety in form validation logic

**Form Validation:** Use React's built-in state management with custom validation hooks rather than external form libraries to maintain simplicity and consistency with existing codebase.

### Security Requirements

[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
**Client-Side Validation:** Implement proper input sanitization and validation, but remember this is primarily UX enhancement. Server-side validation will be critical in subsequent signature persistence stories.

**Accessibility:** Ensure form fields have proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and error announcements for screen readers.

### Core Workflow Integration

[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md]
This story enhances **Workflow 2: Client Activates Agreement** by adding the form validation step:
```
Client->>App: Opens activation link (Story 2.1 ✓)
App->>DB: Fetch client by token (Story 2.1 ✓)  
DB-->>App: Return client data (Story 2.1 ✓)
Client->>App: Submit name + consent (Story 2.2 - This Story)
App->>DB: Create agreement + update status (Story 2.3 - Next)
```

The form validation ensures clients provide required information before proceeding to signature persistence in Story 2.3.

### Project Structure Notes

The existing Next.js App Router structure and ActivationForm component from Story 2.1 align perfectly with the requirements. The form enhancement can be implemented by extending the existing component with additional fields and validation logic, maintaining the established service layer pattern and ShadCN/UI design system.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7 + React Testing Library for unit tests
- **Test File Location:** `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` or co-located with components
- **Setup:** Jest config at `apps/web/jest.config.ts` following Next.js patterns

**Test Types Required:**
- Unit tests for form validation logic and state management
- Component tests for form field interactions and button state changes
- Accessibility tests for proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Integration tests for form validation rules and edge cases

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- Button starts disabled and becomes enabled when both fields are valid
- Name field validation (required, non-empty after trimming whitespace)
- Checkbox validation (must be explicitly checked)
- Form state resets properly and maintains validation state
- Accessibility attributes are present and keyboard navigation works
- Error messages display correctly for invalid states

**Mock Data Strategy:**
- Test various name inputs (valid names, empty strings, whitespace-only)
- Test checkbox states (checked, unchecked, programmatic changes)
- Mock form submission preparation for future integration testing
- Test rapid state changes to ensure validation logic is robust
