## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.5 successfully implemented the asynchronous PDF generation trigger that sets up the pdf_url field in the Agreement record. This confirmation page will consume the completed PDF URL and provide secure download access. The PDF generation process includes comprehensive error handling and retry logic, so this story needs to handle both completed and potentially failed PDF generation scenarios gracefully.

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
**Agreement Model:** The confirmation page will work with Agreement records containing:
- `id`: string (UUID) - Agreement identifier for secure access validation
- `client_id`: string (UUID) - Used to validate client ownership of agreement
- `pdf_url`: string | null - URL to the signed PDF in Supabase Storage (populated by Story 2.5)
- `signed_at`: Date - Signature timestamp for display on confirmation page
- `signer_name`: string - Signer name for verification display
- `terms_version`: string - Terms version for reference on confirmation page

**Client Model:** Related data for personalization:
- `company_name`: string - Used for personalized confirmation messaging
- `logo_url`: string | null - Company logo for branded confirmation page
- `contact_name`: string - Contact name for personalized experience

### Core Workflow Integration

[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md]
This story implements the final confirmation step of **Workflow 2: Client Activates Agreement**:
```
PDF->>DB: Update agreement with pdf_url
PDF-->>App: Success
App->>Client: Show confirmation + download (Story 2.6 - This Story)
```

The confirmation page represents the successful completion of the entire client activation flow, providing:
1. Visual confirmation that the agreement has been signed and processed
2. Secure access to download the final PDF artifact
3. Professional, branded experience maintaining client confidence

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
**Supabase Storage Signed URLs:** The download functionality will use Supabase Storage's signed URL capability:
- **Method:** `supabase.storage.from('agreements').createSignedUrl()`
- **Security:** Time-limited URLs (24-hour expiry) for secure PDF access
- **Privacy:** PDFs stored in private `agreements` bucket, accessible only via signed URLs
- **Authentication:** Page access validated through secure token or session

### File Locations

```

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with App Router for server-side rendering
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage for PDF file management with signed URL capabilities
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with ShadCN/UI components for consistent design
- **State Management:** React Context/Hooks for confirmation page state
- **Authentication:** Token-based validation for secure page access

### Security Requirements

[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
**Service Layer Pattern:** No direct Supabase Storage calls in UI components; use dedicated service layer for signed URL generation
**Secure Downloads:** PDF URLs must be time-limited signed URLs, never direct storage URLs
**Access Validation:** Confirm client ownership of agreement before allowing download
**Token Security:** Validate activation tokens and agreement access permissions

### Accessibility and UX Requirements

**WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance:** All form controls and navigation must meet accessibility standards
**Professional Branding:** Consistent with activation page styling using primary color `#cc2e00`
**Responsive Design:** Seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices
**User Feedback:** Clear success indicators and helpful error messages

### Project Structure Notes

The confirmation page integrates with the completed PDF generation workflow from Stories 2.4 and 2.5. It provides the final step in the client activation process, ensuring clients have secure access to their signed agreement PDF while maintaining professional branding and security standards.
