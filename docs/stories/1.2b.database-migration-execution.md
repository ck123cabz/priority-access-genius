# Story 1.2b: Database Migration Execution

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a clear process for applying Prisma migrations and seeding data,
**so that** the database schema is consistent across all environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A script exists to apply Prisma migrations (`prisma migrate dev`)
2. The migration is successfully applied to local and remote Supabase environments
3. RLS policies are included in the migration

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Verify seed data creation works correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 successfully created the complete Prisma schema with all models (Client, Agreement, AuditEvent, WebhookEndpoint) and comprehensive RLS policies. The migration files already exist:
- packages/db/prisma/migrations/20250819221836_complete_schema_with_rls/migration.sql
- supabase/migrations/20250819221836_complete_schema_with_rls.sql (copied for Supabase)
- supabase/migrations/20250819221900_enable_rls_policies.sql (RLS policies)

The QA review identified that Jest configuration was missing and has been added, which will be useful for testing the migration process.

### Database Schema Details
[Source: architecture/9-database-schema-prisma.md]
The schema includes:
- Client model with activation_token and token_expires_at fields
- Agreement model with cascade delete relationship
- AuditEvent model for audit logging
- WebhookEndpoint model for future extensibility
- All models use UUID primary keys
- Proper indexes on foreign keys and commonly queried fields

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15.1 via Supabase ~1.180
- **ORM:** Prisma ~5.15 for type-safe database access
- **Database Package:** Located at packages/db/ in the monorepo

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
```
packages/
  db/                 # Prisma schema + client
    prisma/
      schema.prisma   # Schema definition
      migrations/     # Prisma migrations
    generated/        # Generated Prisma client
supabase/
  migrations/         # SQL migrations for Supabase
  seed/              # Seed scripts
```

### Development Workflow
[Source: architecture/13-development-workflow.md]
- **Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, pnpm 9+, Docker Desktop for local Supabase, Supabase CLI
- **Local Supabase:** Use `supabase start` to launch local Postgres, Studio, Storage, Realtime
- **Migration commands:** Standard Prisma commands apply (migrate dev, migrate deploy, etc.)

### File Locations
Based on project structure, files should be created at:
- Migration scripts: `packages/db/scripts/` (new directory)
- Seed files: `supabase/seed/` or `packages/db/prisma/seed.ts`
- GitHub workflows: `.github/workflows/`
- Documentation updates: Root `README.md` and `packages/db/README.md`

### Technical Constraints
- Migrations must be compatible with both Prisma and Supabase
- RLS policies must be preserved during migrations
- Seed data must respect authentication context for RLS
- All database operations must maintain referential integrity

### Testing
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit/Component Tests:** Jest + React Testing Library
  - Configuration already added in Story 1.2: `packages/db/jest.config.js`
  - Test files location: `packages/db/__tests__/`
- **CI Integration:** GitHub Actions workflow needed for migration validation
- **Test Requirements:**
  - Test migration application and rollback
  - Verify RLS policies after migration
  - Test seed data creation
  - Ensure idempotency of migration scripts

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts identified. The existing migration structure aligns with the unified project structure. The migration files are properly separated between Prisma migrations (packages/db/prisma/migrations/) and Supabase-specific SQL migrations (supabase/migrations/).
