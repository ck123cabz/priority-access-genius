## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.2 successfully implemented comprehensive form validation for the e-signature consent logic with security enhancements including HTML tag detection and XSS prevention. The existing ActivationForm component now collects the full name and consent checkbox state, providing the foundation for signature persistence. The useActivationForm hook provides robust client-side validation with real-time feedback, and all acceptance criteria were met with excellent security and performance optimizations.

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
**Agreement Model:** This story implements the core Agreement data model:
- `id`: string (UUID) - Unique identifier for the agreement record
- `client_id`: string (UUID) - Foreign key linking to the Client
- `terms_version`: string - The version of the legal terms the client agreed to
- `pdf_url`: string | null - URL to the signed PDF (nullable until generated in Story 2.4)
- `signed_at`: Date - The exact timestamp when the client confirmed their agreement
- `signer_name`: string - The full name the client typed as their e-signature
- `signer_ip`: string - The IP address of the client at the time of signing
- `signature_hash`: string - A hash of key signature details to ensure data integrity
- `created_at`: Date - Timestamp of when the record was created

**Client Model Updates:** This story updates the Client model:
- `status`: 'pending' | 'activated' - Updated from 'pending' to 'activated' when agreement is signed
- Foreign key relationship: One Client can have many Agreements

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
**Primary Data Access:** Use Supabase JavaScript Client SDK with types generated from Prisma for end-to-end type safety. The story will implement CRUD operations for the Agreement model through the Supabase client.

**Server Action Pattern:** This story will implement signature persistence as a Next.js server action rather than a separate API endpoint, following the App Router patterns and providing better integration with form submission.

### Database Schema

[Source: architecture/9-database-schema-prisma.md]
**Agreement Prisma Model:**
```prisma
model Agreement {
  id             String   @id @default(uuid())
  client_id      String
  terms_version  String
  pdf_url        String?
  signed_at      DateTime
  signer_name    String
  signer_ip      String
  signature_hash String
  created_at     DateTime @default(now())
  client         Client   @relation(fields: [client_id], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

**Client Model Relationship:**
```prisma
model Client {
  // ... other fields
  agreements        Agreement[]
}
```

### Backend Architecture

[Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture-selected-highlights.md]
**Repository Pattern:** Implement repository pattern for Prisma access to maintain clean separation between data access and business logic.

**Function Template:** Use CORS handling and JSON responses pattern for consistent error handling.

### File Locations

[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
Based on the unified project structure and Next.js App Router patterns:
```
apps/web/
  src/actions/
    signature-actions.ts                 # New: server actions for signature persistence
  src/lib/
    agreements.ts                        # New: agreement repository/service layer
    signature-utils.ts                   # New: signature hash and IP utilities
  packages/types/
    agreement.ts                         # New: shared Agreement TypeScript interfaces
  packages/db/
    prisma/schema.prisma                 # Existing: verify Agreement model exists
  app/activate/[token]/
    components/
      activation-form.tsx                # Modify: integrate with signature persistence
```

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language:** TypeScript ~5.4 for type safety in server actions
- **ORM:** Prisma ~5.15 for type-safe database access and transaction management
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15.1 provided by Supabase
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth for secure client token validation
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with App Router for server actions integration

**Transaction Requirements:** Use Prisma's transaction API to ensure atomic operations when creating agreements and updating client status.

### Security Requirements

[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
**Server-Side Validation:** Implement comprehensive server-side validation for all signature data including:
- Name validation (length limits, character requirements, HTML tag prevention)
- Client token validation and expiry checking
- IP address validation and logging
- Signature hash generation for data integrity

**Service Layer Pattern:** No direct Supabase calls in components - use service layer for all database operations.

### Core Workflow Integration

[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md]
This story implements the critical signature persistence step in **Workflow 2: Client Activates Agreement**:
```
Client->>App: Submit name + consent (Story 2.2 âœ“)
App->>DB: Create agreement + update status (Story 2.3 - This Story)
App->>PDF: Invoke generate-pdf (Story 2.4 - Next)
```

The signature persistence ensures that:
1. Agreement record is created with all required signature details
2. Client status is atomically updated to "activated"
3. Data integrity is maintained through proper transaction handling
4. Foundation is prepared for PDF generation in Story 2.4

### Project Structure Notes

The existing Next.js App Router structure and ActivationForm component from Stories 2.1 and 2.2 provide the perfect foundation. The form validation and submission logic can be enhanced to call server actions for signature persistence, maintaining the established service layer pattern and ShadCN/UI design system while adding the critical backend persistence functionality.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7 + React Testing Library for unit tests
- **Test File Location:** `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` following Next.js patterns
- **Setup:** Jest config at `apps/web/jest.config.ts` following existing patterns

**Test Types Required:**
- Unit tests for signature persistence server actions and service layer functions
- Integration tests for form submission and database transaction handling
- Component tests for form integration with signature persistence
- Database tests for Agreement model operations and foreign key relationships
- Error handling tests for various failure scenarios

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- Successful agreement creation with all required fields populated
- Client status update from "pending" to "activated" during transaction
- Transaction rollback when any part of the signature persistence fails
- Signature hash generation produces consistent, valid hashes
- IP address capture works correctly in various network configurations
- Concurrent signature attempts are handled properly
- Invalid or expired tokens are rejected with proper error messages
- Database constraint violations are handled gracefully

**Mock Data Strategy:**
- Test Agreement records with various field combinations
- Mock client records in different states (pending, activated)
- Mock IP addresses for testing geolocation scenarios
- Mock signature hash generation for predictable test outcomes
- Test transaction scenarios with simulated database failures
- Mock server action contexts for proper Next.js integration testing
