## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.10 successfully implemented comprehensive test infrastructure with robust testing capabilities. The application now has solid testing foundations and CI/CD pipeline integration. This story builds upon the deployment infrastructure to provide professional domain access that will inspire client confidence in the activation process.

### Domain/DNS Configuration Requirements

[Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]
**Primary Production Domain:** `priorityaccess.yourdomain.com` (placeholder - needs actual domain)
**Staging Domain:** `staging.priorityaccess.yourdomain.com`
**DNS Provider:** Cloudflare (recommended) or domain registrar DNS
**SSL/TLS:** Managed automatically by Vercel

**Domain Configuration Process:**
1. Register domain through preferred registrar
2. Configure DNS to point to Vercel nameservers
3. Add domain to Vercel project settings
4. Configure environment-specific subdomains
5. Set up custom domain for Supabase project (optional)

### Deployment Platform Details

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**Primary Hosting:** Vercel (provides seamless CI/CD, global edge network, serverless infrastructure)
**Backend Platform:** Supabase ~1.180 (BaaS - database, auth, storage, serverless functions)
**Observability:** Vercel/Supabase built-in logging and analytics

[Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]
**Vercel Configuration:** Next.js defaults for build output
**Protection:** "Protect Preview Deployments" option available
**Integration:** GitHub repo import into Vercel

### Environment Configuration

[Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]
**Environment Structure:**
- **Preview:** Every PR → Vercel Preview + isolated Supabase schema (optional)
- **Staging:** `main` branch → Vercel env = `staging` + Supabase project `staging`
- **Production:** Tagged release → Vercel env = `production` + Supabase `prod`

**URL Structure:**
- **Production:** `https://priorityaccess.yourdomain.com`
- **Staging:** `https://staging.priorityaccess.yourdomain.com`
- **Preview:** `https://priority-access-git-[branch]-[team].vercel.app`

[Source: architecture/13-development-workflow.md]
- Environment variables stored in `.env` at repo root (consumed by Next.js)
- Additional `.env.local` file option available

### File Locations

[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
Based on the unified project structure, domain configuration files needed:
```
/ (repo root)
  apps/web/                # Next.js 14 App Router
  .github/workflows/       # CI pipelines (Vercel, Supabase)
  docs/deployment/         # Deployment documentation
    environment-variables.md
    vercel-setup.md
  vercel.json             # Vercel configuration file
  .env                    # Environment variables
```

[Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]
**CI/CD Configuration:** `.github/workflows/supabase-deploy.yml`
**Environment Variables:** Set in Vercel per environment (same names as `.env`)

### Security Requirements

[Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]
**SSL/TLS:** Automatically managed by Vercel
**Environment Protection:** "Protect Preview Deployments" option in Vercel

[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
**Storage Security:**
- `logos` bucket: public-read, write via RLS
- `agreements` bucket: private, signed URLs only
**RLS Policies:** Operators can select/insert/update clients where `created_by = auth.uid()`

### Deployment Process Integration

[Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]
**Promotion Strategy:**
- PR → Preview → merge to `main` → auto deploy to **Staging**
- Tag `vX.Y.Z` → deploy to **Production** (protected)

**GitHub Actions Configuration:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/supabase-deploy.yml
name: Supabase Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with App Router
- **Node.js Version:** 20 (as specified in CI/CD pipeline)
- **Package Manager:** pnpm 9+
- **Docker:** Docker Desktop (for local Supabase)

**Domain-specific Constraints:**
- Domain must support SSL certificate provisioning
- DNS propagation time consideration (24-48 hours)
- Environment separation for staging/production domains
- Compatibility with Vercel's domain management system

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
- ESLint + Prettier enforced in CI
- Service layer pattern maintained for any domain-related utilities
- TypeScript strict mode for domain configuration utilities
- Consistent naming conventions for environment-related files
- Documentation standards for deployment procedures

### Project Structure Notes

The existing monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces aligns well with domain configuration requirements. The `docs/deployment/` directory already exists and provides excellent organization for domain configuration documentation. The existing CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/` provides the foundation for integrating domain-aware deployment processes.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7 + React Testing Library for unit tests
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright ~1.44 for end-to-end testing
- **Test File Location:** `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` or co-located with components
- **Setup:** Jest config at `apps/web/jest.config.ts`, Playwright config at `playwright.config.ts`

**Test Types Required:**
- Unit tests for any domain configuration utilities
- Integration tests for environment URL generation
- Validation tests for domain-related environment variables
- E2E tests for domain access and SSL verification
- Documentation tests for deployment procedures

**Domain Configuration Testing Strategy:**
- Test environment-specific URL generation functions
- Validate domain configuration utilities
- Test SSL certificate validation
- Ensure environment variable handling for domain settings
- Validate domain-related middleware or routing logic
