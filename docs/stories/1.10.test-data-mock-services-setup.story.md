```

**Integration with Existing Structure:**
- `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` - Component-specific test files
- `packages/db/` - Database-related test utilities
- `supabase/seed/` - Production seed scripts (separate from test seeds)

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7 + React Testing Library for unit tests
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright ~1.44 for end-to-end testing
- **Test File Location:** `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/` or co-located with components
- **Setup:** Jest config at `apps/web/jest.config.ts`, Playwright config at `playwright.config.ts`

**Critical Test Scenarios for Mock Data:**
- Smoke flow: activation link -> sign -> confirm -> download PDF
- Error handling: invalid tokens, network failures, PDF generation timeouts
- Security: unauthorized access attempts, XSS prevention
- Mobile responsiveness: full flow on mobile devices
- Performance: page load times under 2 seconds

**Mock Data Requirements:**
- Consistent test data across test runs
- Various client states (pending, activated, expired)
- Different user permission levels for RLS testing
- Predictable file URLs for storage testing
- Simulated network conditions for performance testing

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with App Router
- **Testing:** Jest ~29.7 + React Testing Library, Playwright ~1.44
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15.1 with Prisma ORM ~5.15
- **Backend:** Supabase with TypeScript (Deno) for Edge Functions
- **Node.js Version:** 20 (as specified in CI/CD pipeline)

**Mock Service Constraints:**
- Mock services must use TypeScript for type safety
- Compatibility with Jest testing environment
- Integration with Playwright for E2E testing
- Supabase client mocking for database operations
- File system mocking for storage operations

### Security Requirements

Mock services should not expose any real credentials or sensitive data:
- Use test-only API keys and tokens
- Mock authentication without real OAuth flows
- Simulate RLS policies without real database access
- Test data should be clearly identifiable as test data
- No production data should be used in test environments

### Performance Considerations

**Test Performance Optimization:**
- Fast test data seeding and cleanup operations
- Efficient mock service response times
- Memory-efficient fixture data loading
- Parallel test execution support
- Minimal test database setup overhead

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
- Service layer pattern maintained for mock implementations
- ESLint + Prettier enforced for test code
- TypeScript strict mode for all mock services
- Consistent naming conventions for test files and utilities
- Documentation standards for mock service usage

### Project Structure Notes

The existing monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces provides excellent organization for test utilities. The separation of `apps/web` and `packages/db` allows for targeted mock implementations. The existing test setup in the CI/CD pipeline provides the foundation for integrating comprehensive mock services and test data.
