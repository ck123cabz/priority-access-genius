# Client FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is an activation link?
An activation link is a secure, unique URL that allows you to electronically sign your agreement with the service provider. Each link is specific to your company and can only be used once.

### How long is my activation link valid?
Activation links expire after 24 hours for security reasons. If your link has expired, contact your service provider to request a new one.

### Is the activation process legally binding?
Yes, completing the activation process creates a legally binding electronic signature on your agreement. This has the same legal effect as a handwritten signature.

### What information do I need to provide?
You only need to provide your full legal name and consent to the terms and conditions. No other personal information is required during activation.

## Technical Questions

The activation system works with all modern browsers including:

### What if JavaScript is disabled?

## Process Questions

### Why is the "Activate Agreement" button disabled?
The activation button only becomes enabled after you:
1. Enter your full legal name
2. Check the consent checkbox

Both requirements must be completed for the button to activate.

### How long does processing take?
Processing typically takes 10-30 seconds. In some cases, PDF generation may take up to 2 minutes. Please be patient and don't refresh the page during processing.

### Can I activate the agreement more than once?
No, each activation link can only be used once. After successful activation, the link becomes invalid for security reasons.

## Error Questions

### What if I get an "expired link" error?

### The page shows "Something went wrong" - what now?
This usually indicates a temporary issue. Try:
1. Wait 5 minutes and refresh the page
2. Try a different web browser
3. Clear your browser cache and try again
4. If the issue persists, contact support

### I can't click the activation button - why?

### Can I cancel after activating?
Once activated, the agreement becomes legally binding. Any cancellation would need to follow the terms specified in your agreement. Contact your service provider to discuss your specific situation.
