# Link Sharing Best Practices

## Overview
This guide provides best practices for securely and effectively sharing activation links with your clients to ensure successful agreement completions.

## Security Best Practices

### Secure Communication Channels
**Recommended Methods:**
- Direct email from business account to client's business email
- Secure client portal or project management system
- Encrypted messaging platforms approved by your organization
- Phone call to provide link verbally (for highly sensitive clients)

**Avoid These Methods:**
- Social media messages or posts
- Public forums or shared documents
- Unencrypted personal email accounts
- Text messages (unless specifically requested and approved)

### Link Handling Security
**Do:**
- Copy activation links directly from the dashboard
- Verify the complete URL is included when sharing
- Use HTTPS links only (URLs should start with "https://")
- Keep activation links confidential and share only with authorized recipients

**Don't:**
- Forward activation emails to unauthorized parties
- Share links in public channels or group communications
- Modify or shorten activation URLs
- Save activation links in unsecured locations

### Verification Procedures
Before sharing activation links:
- **Confirm Client Identity**: Verify you're communicating with the correct contact
- **Check Email Addresses**: Ensure client email addresses are current and correct
- **Validate Authority**: Confirm the recipient has authority to sign agreements
- **Review Client Details**: Double-check company information in the system
