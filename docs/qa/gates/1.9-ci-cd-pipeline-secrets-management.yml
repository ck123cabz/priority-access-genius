review_notes: |
  Outstanding implementation of a production-ready CI/CD pipeline that exceeds all acceptance criteria.
  The multi-tier deployment strategy (Preview → Staging → Production) follows enterprise best practices.
  Comprehensive security measures including secrets scanning, JWT validation, and proper environment isolation.
  Robust testing infrastructure with parallel execution, proper mocking, and isolated test environments.
  Excellent error handling, retry mechanisms, and health monitoring throughout the deployment pipeline.
  Code quality improvements were applied during review including enhanced security scanning and health check reliability.
  All documentation is comprehensive and deployment procedures are well-defined.
  This implementation provides a solid foundation for reliable software delivery.
