# **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Priority Access Confirmation System, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## **Starter Template or Existing Project**

Based on the PRD, the project specifies a very modern and precise technology stack: **Next.js 14 (App Router), Supabase, and Vercel deployment**. While a specific named starter kit (like “T3 Stack”) isn’t mentioned, this combination is perfectly suited for Vercel’s official Next.js starter template.

Our approach is to use the **Vercel/Next.js starter** and add explicit user stories in the first epic for:

1. Auditing the default configurations.
    
2. Manually integrating the Supabase client and Prisma ORM.
    
3. Creating an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) in the docs folder to log this choice and its rationale.
