# **1. Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**

- Provide a branded, secure, and low-friction confirmation and e-signature experience.
    
- Automatically generate and store a signed PDF artifact for legal defensibility.
    
- Give operators real-time visibility into the activation status of clients.
    
- Reduce the median Time-to-Activation (TTA) from days to under 30 minutes.
    

## **Background Context**

The current process for client activation relies on manually emailing PDF agreements, which is a slow and high-friction workflow. This delay between a verbal agreement and a formal signature can take several days, leading to lost conversions and significant administrative overhead for operators.

This project will replace that manual system with a streamlined, web-based flow. Operators will generate a unique link that clients can use to review terms and provide a legally sufficient e-signature. This will drastically reduce confirmation time, improve conversion rates, and automate a costly operational bottleneck.
